# Readme

This project demonstrates how to use the Ferretly API to obtain information about your API client.

Each API key is associated with a single Ferretly API "client". The client contains information such as the owner name, the OrganizationId to which the client is associated, a webhook URL, and custom properties.
 
## Getting Started

Update appSettings.json to add the value of your API key to the `X-Api-Key` setting.
